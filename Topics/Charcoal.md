## Before You Begin

You are about to enter the "Sketchy and Shady" world of charcoal. Until now if charcoal made you think of barbeque, it's all going to change for the good. This section will introduce charcoal to you and I am sure it will foster a long lasting bond..

**Understand the nature of {{page.medium}}**
* This is a dry and chalky medium.
* This does not erase like graphite, hence corrections are challenging.


**Best practices for {{page.medium}} painting**
* Always keep a rag handy as this is a messy medium.
* Layer your work from light to dark.
* White highlights must be left as white. White charcoal is not very effective for highlights. 
* Always fix your work with a charcoal fixative.

**What to avoid**
* Never mount your charcoal master piece as is. Always mount your work using mat and glass when you frame it. The glass must not touch your work.
* Do not sharpen your charcoal pencils. Learn to chisel them instead.
