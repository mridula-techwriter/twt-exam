## Before You Begin

You must be very excited to embark on this colorful journey. However there are few things I would like to tell you to help you  get started without much fuss. Let's call them 'Best Practices'. These will save you a lot of frustration when you work with {{page.medium}} paints. 

**Understand the nature of {{page.medium}} paints**
* These paints dry very fast.
* They dry a shade darker.

**Best practices for {{page.medium}} painting**
* It helps if you keep a mist bottle handy to keep your canvas wet. This helps the paint stay wet for a longer time.
* Do not dilute {{page.medium}} paints if you want to use them as opaque paints.
* If you mix colors to create a lighter shade ensure that the shade is a little extra light as it will dry darker.
* Layer from dark to light. Keep the darkest and lightest colors for finishing touches.

**What to avoid**
* If you mist your canvas, you must not take too much water in your brush.
* Do not paint for long hours without washing your brushes in between. You must not allow the paint to dry near the foot of the bristles. This will give your brushes a longer shelf life.
